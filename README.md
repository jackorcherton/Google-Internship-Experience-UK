# Internship Experience UK Google
This repository is my attempt at the Internship Experience 2021 Coding Challenge, powered by the [Bright Network](https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/).

The challenge was created by [Google](https://www.google.com/), and we were tasked at making a command-line version of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) — to view the detailed instructions see codeing-challenge-instructions.pdf.

## Running the Code
To run the code you must be running Python > 3.7, the code has no dependencies, and to run it — head to the root of this repository and type ` python3 -m src.run`.

The code passes all the tests set by Google, and to check for yourself please run `python3 -m pytest test`. **NB:** you must have pytest installed to do this.
